# YouTube Webpage
> Task is to clone YouTube’s video player page using web archive link: http://archive.today/Bss88 as a source page.

We made a clone of the youtube player page, it has a functional video, buttons, and interactive icons. The page works best on a 1366x768 resolution and using the firefox browser, assets might look out of place using other browsers or resolutions. It has mock suggestions showing video name and views, and a mock section for commentaries. The focus of this branch was to make everything fit in their right places, along with a functional youtube video player.
